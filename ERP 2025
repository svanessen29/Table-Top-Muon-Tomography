##Research summary:
In the 2025 Experimental research project we tried to find a relationship between the PMT voltage and PMT time arrival and the dinstance to a muon coincidence. We measured the voltagas and arrival times on 7 different locations on the scintillator plate and reported the measured relationships with the corresponding distances. 
  We used the two scanner arm PMT to trigger for a result so we could know for certain where the muon coincidence occured. To make sure the trigger was done at the right voltage, we measured the ideal trigger threshold for both scanner arm PMT's by finding a relationship between the number of counts and the trigger voltage. 
  We found that when the PMT was further from a muon hit, the voltage amplitude decreased and the arrival time increased. The amplitudes decreased fairly quickly over longer distances, so including smaller distances could be wise. For the arrival times, the problem that occured was the absence of an absolute time clock. We only measured the relative time difference between the PMT that gave the first signal and the 3 other PMT's. Introducing an absolute time clock will give the possibilty the measure the time differences when the trigger arms are not next to a corner PMT.

The code that was used for the analysis can be found here.
